# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables a local-first frontend web application built with Preact and Fresh to access YouTube subscription data and new content feeds. Due to YouTube API CORS restrictions, the system will implement a hybrid architecture using Deno backend services for API communication while maintaining local-first data storage in browser databases. The focus is on fetching user subscriptions and aggregating new content from subscribed channels.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement YouTube subscription access through a Deno backend service, so that I can retrieve user subscription data while maintaining local-first storage principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing YouTube API access THEN the system SHALL use YouTube Data API v3 subscriptions.list endpoint through Deno backend services
2. WHEN authenticating with YouTube THEN the system SHALL implement OAuth 2.0 flow with appropriate scopes (youtube.readonly) through the backend service
3. WHEN API responses are received THEN the system SHALL forward complete subscription data including channel IDs, titles, and metadata to the frontend
4. IF API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff and caching strategies with quota monitoring

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my YouTube subscriptions in the application, so that I can see all channels I follow in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I authenticate with YouTube THEN the system SHALL retrieve my complete subscription list via the backend service
2. WHEN subscriptions are loaded THEN the system SHALL display channel names, thumbnails, subscriber counts, and descriptions
3. WHEN subscription data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL store it locally in the browser database for offline access
4. IF subscription sync fails THEN the system SHALL display cached subscription data and show sync status

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see new content from my subscribed channels, so that I can stay updated with the latest videos from creators I follow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new content is available THEN the system SHALL fetch recent videos from all subscribed channels via the backend service
2. WHEN new videos are retrieved THEN the system SHALL display video titles, thumbnails, upload dates, and view counts
3. WHEN content is fetched THEN the system SHALL store video metadata locally and mark videos as new/unviewed
4. IF content fetching fails THEN the system SHALL show cached content and indicate last successful sync time

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my YouTube data interactions to be stored locally, so that I can access my data offline and maintain privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN YouTube data is retrieved THEN the system SHALL store it in the browser's local database
2. WHEN the application is offline THEN the system SHALL serve cached YouTube data from local storage
3. WHEN local storage reaches capacity limits THEN the system SHALL implement a data retention policy
4. WHEN user requests data deletion THEN the system SHALL remove all locally stored YouTube data

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate with YouTube securely, so that the application can access my subscription data while protecting my privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I initiate YouTube login THEN the system SHALL redirect me to YouTube's OAuth 2.0 authorization page
2. WHEN I grant permissions THEN the system SHALL securely store access tokens on the backend service
3. WHEN tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh them using stored refresh tokens
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and allow re-authentication

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the YouTube integration to work efficiently with minimal API usage, so that I can have a smooth browsing experience without hitting rate limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN syncing subscription data THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent caching to minimize API calls
2. WHEN loading new content THEN the system SHALL batch channel requests and use efficient pagination
3. WHEN displaying content THEN the system SHALL prioritize locally cached data and sync in the background
4. WHEN API quotas are approached THEN the system SHALL implement smart scheduling and user notification of sync delays

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to play YouTube videos directly in the application, so that I can watch content without leaving the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on a video THEN the system SHALL embed the YouTube player using the YouTube Player API
2. WHEN a video is playing THEN the system SHALL track playback progress and automatically mark as watched when completed
3. WHEN I interact with the player THEN the system SHALL support standard controls (play, pause, seek, volume, fullscreen)
4. IF a video is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and suggest alternatives

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see algorithmic scores for videos, so that I can prioritize which content to watch based on relevance and quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN videos are displayed THEN the system SHALL calculate and show a relevance score for each video
2. WHEN calculating scores THEN the system SHALL consider factors like channel engagement, video recency, user viewing history, and video metadata
3. WHEN scores are computed THEN the system SHALL display them visually (e.g., star rating, percentage, or color coding)
4. WHEN I sort content THEN the system SHALL allow sorting by score in addition to date and channel

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my content consumption, so that I can track what I've watched and organize my viewing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view a video THEN the system SHALL mark it as watched in the local database
2. WHEN I want to filter content THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by watched/unwatched status, channel, date, and score range
3. WHEN I want to save videos THEN the system SHALL allow bookmarking videos for later viewing
4. IF I want to export my data THEN the system SHALL provide options to export viewing history, bookmarks, and scoring data

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control the visibility of brand new videos, so that I can focus on scored content while optionally viewing unscored recent uploads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN videos are published within the last 24 hours THEN the system SHALL filter them out from the main content feed by default
2. WHEN I want to see recent unscored videos THEN the system SHALL provide an optional toggle to show "awaiting scoring" content
3. WHEN displaying unscored videos THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate their "awaiting scoring" status with appropriate visual cues
4. WHEN the 24-hour period expires THEN the system SHALL automatically move videos to the main feed and begin scoring calculations

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter videos by mood categories, so that I can find content that matches my current emotional state or desired experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN videos are processed on the server THEN the system SHALL assign one of six predefined mood values: Learn, Fun, Love, Play, Discover, Reflect
2. WHEN determining video mood THEN the system SHALL analyze channel description, video description, and subtitles text (if available) using OpenAI API with a predefined mood classification prompt
3. WHEN I want to filter by mood THEN the system SHALL provide mood filter options in the user interface allowing single or multiple mood selection
4. WHEN mood filtering is applied THEN the system SHALL display only videos matching the selected mood categories

### Requirement 12

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see recommended videos based on mood and score, so that I can easily find high-quality content that matches my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enable the Recommended filter THEN the system SHALL sort videos by score from high to low within the current view
2. WHEN I combine Recommended filter with mood selection THEN the system SHALL first filter by selected mood(s) and then sort the results by score high-to-low
3. WHEN Recommended filter is active THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate the sorting method in the user interface
4. WHEN no mood is selected with Recommended filter THEN the system SHALL show all videos sorted by score high-to-low
